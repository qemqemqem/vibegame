## 🎯 Current Status: **DEPLOYED** - Live at https://qemqemqem.github.io/vibegame/

## ✅ Completed Successfully
1. **Repository Setup**: ✅ Complete
   - All files committed and pushed to GitHub
   - Repository made public for GitHub Pages compatibility
   - Clean, organized project structure maintained

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: ✅ Complete
   - Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

   - Tests passing successfully

3. **Project Organization**: ✅ Complete
   - Removed duplicate package.json files
   - Maintained clean separation: frontend/, backend/, tests/, config/
   - All tests working locally and in CI

## ✅ SOLVED: GitHub Pages Deployment

### Solution Implemented
Used the `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` action which:
1. ✅ Automatically creates `gh-pages` branch
2. ✅ Deploys frontend files to that branch  
3. ✅ Enables GitHub Pages via API call
4. ✅ Site now live and auto-updating on commits

### Final Working Approach
1. ✅ Created `.github/workflows/static-deploy.yml`
2. ✅ Used peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 action
3. ✅ Enabled Pages with gh-pages branch via API
4. ✅ Site building and deploying automatically

## 🎲 Live Deployment URLs
- **Repository**: https://github.com/qemqemqem/vibegame
- **Live Game**: https://qemqemqem.github.io/vibegame/ ✅ DEPLOYED

## 🔧 Workflow Status
- **Latest Run**: `Add alternative static deployment workflow`
- **Status**: ✅ SUCCESS (deployed via peaceiris action)
- **Test Stage**: ✅ Passing (all backend tests successful)
- **Deploy Stage**: ✅ SUCCESS (auto-deploying on commits)

## 🏃‍♂️ Ready for Vibecoding
The game itself is **100% deployment-ready**:
- ✅ Frontend builds successfully 
- ✅ Backend has comprehensive mocking for testing
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Mobile-optimized design
- ✅ Clean project structure

**The only blocker is the GitHub Pages setup step!**

## 🎯 Recommended Action
1. **Quick Win**: Manually enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
2. **Alternative**: Deploy to Netlify/Vercel which auto-detects the frontend folder
3. **Fallback**: Use the Python server locally (`python backend/server.py --mock`)
