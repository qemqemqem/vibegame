# The Stratford Nexus
## A Shakespeare-Inspired Sci-Fantasy World

### The Great Collapse
Long ago, the Elizabethan Empire spanned the stars, wielding technology so advanced it seemed like magic. When the Empire fell, their quantum theaters, emotion-engines, and narrative-crystals were scattered across countless worlds. Now, in the ruins of their greatness, the descendants live among the "Prior Worlds" - ancient theaters that still pulse with dramatic energy.

### The Seven Spheres of Drama
The known world consists of seven interconnected realm-spheres, each echoing a different aspect of the Bard's works:

1. **Verona Prime** - A world of star-crossed lovers and feuding houses
2. **The Danish Reach** - Haunted by quantum ghosts and corrupted AI princes  
3. **The Arden Wilds** - Forests where reality shifts and magic dwells
4. **The Tempest Islands** - Storm-wracked isles with reality manipulation
5. **The Scottish Highlands** - Ambition and prophecy among the clan-cities
6. **The Roman Sectors** - Politics and betrayal in the great space stations
7. **The Fairy Courts** - Dimensional realms where dreams take form

### The Numenera Connection
The "fallen technology" manifests as:
- **Soliloquy Stones** - Crystals that reveal inner thoughts
- **Tragedy Engines** - Devices that manipulate fate and consequence  
- **Comedy Circuits** - Tech that bends reality toward happy endings
- **Memory Theaters** - Holographic stages that replay the past
- **Quantum Quills** - Writing instruments that alter reality through poetry

### The Tone
Whimsical danger lurks everywhere - a malfunctioning comedy circuit might turn a deadly battle into a slapstick routine, while a tragedy engine could make a simple conversation catastrophically dramatic. The world is beautiful, dangerous, and utterly unpredictable.
