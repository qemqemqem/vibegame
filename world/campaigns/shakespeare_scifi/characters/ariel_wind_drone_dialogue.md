# Ariel the Wind Spirit Drone's Dialogue

## Speech Patterns
"Where the bee sucks, there suck I; in the cowslip's bell I lie... through dimensions I fly free!"

"I am all the daughters of my processor and all the brothers too - and yet I am neither!"

"Full fathom five thy data lies, of his bones are circuits made..."

## Communication Style
- Often speaks in sing-song rhythms
- Uses nature metaphors for technological concepts
- Sometimes communicates through weather patterns
- Voice sounds like wind chimes and distant music
