# Prospero the Technomancer's Secrets

## Hidden Motivations
Prospero was exiled not for political reasons, but because he discovered the true cause of the Great Collapse - his own brother Antonio activated a reality-virus that corrupted the Empire's core narrative engines.

## The Tempest Device
His island contains the prototype for the Empire's greatest weapon - a device that can rewrite the fundamental stories that govern reality itself.

## Plot Hooks
- Seeks worthy heroes to help him restore the narrative balance
- Knows the location of other Great Devices across the Seven Spheres
- His experiments occasionally tear holes in reality
- Miranda doesn't know she's actually an AI recreation of his real daughter
