# Puck the Probability Sprite's Dialogue

## Speech Patterns
"Lord, what fools these mortals be! But what wonderful, chaotic, beautiful fools!"

"I jest to Oberon and make him smile when I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile!"

"Oh ho! The probability waves are singing today - shall we dance with chaos, my dears?"

## Quirks
- Often speaks in outdated slang from multiple time periods
- Finishes others' sentences with unexpected rhymes
- Occasionally glitches into pure data-static when excited
- Refers to serious situations as "debug opportunities"
