# The Weird Sisters - Quantum Fortune Teller Collective's Dialogue

## Speech Patterns
"When shall we three meet again? In thunder, lightning, or in rain? When the hurly-burly's done, when the battle's lost and won..."

"Fair is foul, and foul is fair - hover through the fog and filthy air of probability space!"

"Double, double, toil and trouble; fire burn and cauldron bubble; quantum states in chaos dance!"

## Collective Speaking
- Often finish each other's sentences
- Speak in rhyming couplets when giving prophecies
- Refer to themselves as "we" even when only one is speaking
- Mix archaic language with technical jargon
