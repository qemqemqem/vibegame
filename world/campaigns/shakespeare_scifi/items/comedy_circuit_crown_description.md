# The Comedy Circuit Crown

A delicate circlet of golden wire embedded with tiny crystal nodes that pulse with warm light. When worn, it subtly adjusts probability to favor comedic outcomes and happy endings.

## Appearance
- Intricate golden wireframe that resembles both circuitry and a laurel wreath
- Seven small gems representing each of the Seven Spheres
- Holographic butterflies that occasionally flutter around the wearer's head
- Adjusts size automatically to fit any wearer

## Effects
While worn, the crown creates a "comedy field" that:
- Makes embarrassing accidents happen to enemies instead of allies
- Increases the likelihood of fortunate coincidences
- Prevents truly tragic outcomes (though inconvenience is still possible)
- Makes the wearer more charismatic and likeable

## Side Effects
- Wearer occasionally speaks in puns without meaning to
- Serious situations become slightly absurd
- Animals are inexplicably drawn to the wearer
- Food always tastes better when the wearer is around
