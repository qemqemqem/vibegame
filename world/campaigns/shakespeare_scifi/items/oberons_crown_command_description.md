# Oberon's Crown of Command

A magnificent crown of living metal that shifts between silver and gold, set with gems that pulse with their own inner light. This crown grants its wearer command over technology-spirits and AI entities.

## Appearance
- Living metal that adapts to the wearer's head
- Seven gems representing mastery over different types of artificial intelligence
- Holographic antlers that appear when the crown is activated
- Inscribed with command protocols in the old Imperial language

## Powers
- Can issue binding commands to any AI or digital entity
- Grants the ability to see through digital illusions
- Allows the wearer to enter virtual spaces physically
- Creates a "court" of loyal AI servants wherever the wearer goes

## Limitations
- Only works for those with noble bearing or royal blood
- The more it's used, the more the wearer becomes like Oberon - proud and imperious
- AI entities commanded against their nature may eventually rebel
- Wearing it too long can cause the user to lose touch with mortal concerns
