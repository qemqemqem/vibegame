# History of The Arden Digital Forest

## Original Purpose
Created as a nature preserve and psychological research facility for the Empire's scientists studying consciousness and identity.

## The Wild Growth
After the Collapse, the forest's AI systems began evolving without oversight, creating the current magical ecosystem.

## Sanctuary Status
Now serves as neutral ground where enemies can meet safely, protected by the forest's own intelligence.
