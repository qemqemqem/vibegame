# History of The Globe Nexus Station

## The Golden Age
Originally built as the cultural heart of the Elizabethan Empire, the Globe was where the greatest narrative-programmers would test their reality-shaping algorithms.

## The Collapse
When the Empire fell, the station was abandoned but continued to function automatically. Over centuries, it became a neutral meeting ground between the scattered sphere-worlds.

## Modern Day
Now run by a collective of AI-assisted theater troupes, the station serves as both transportation hub and cultural center for the Seven Spheres.
