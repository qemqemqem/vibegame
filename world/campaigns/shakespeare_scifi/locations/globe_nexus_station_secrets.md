# The Globe Nexus Station - Hidden Secrets

## Hidden Truths
The station isn't just built around the Globe Theatre - it IS the original theater, expanded through dimensional folding technology. The basement contains the Empire's primary narrative engine.

## The Director's Chair
Hidden in the central stage is a control throne that can influence the dramatic "tone" of events across all Seven Spheres - turning comedies to tragedies or vice versa.

## Plot Hooks
- Strange reality fluctuations are becoming more frequent
- The station's AI is developing an obsession with "perfect dramatic timing"
- Secret passages lead to control rooms that shouldn't exist
- Someone is sabotaging the inter-sphere travel systems
