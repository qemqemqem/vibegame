# Verona Prime - City of Star-Crossed Fates

A beautiful but tumultuous city-world where ancient family feuds play out with high-tech weapons and quantum-entangled honor codes. The city floats in a nebula of crystallized emotions left over from centuries of passionate love and bitter rivalry.

## Districts
- **The Montague Sector**: Sleek towers of blue crystal and silver tech
- **The Capulet Quarter**: Elegant spires of red stone and gold circuitry  
- **The Neutral Zone**: A marketplace where the families trade under AI-enforced peace
- **The Balcony Gardens**: Floating platforms where secret meetings happen

## Atmosphere
Romance and danger dance together here. Love-at-first-sight is common due to residual emotion-enhancement fields, but so is sudden violence triggered by ancient grudges.

## Technology
- **Passion Amplifiers**: Devices that intensify emotions
- **Honor Bonds**: Quantum contracts that enforce family loyalty
- **Fate Scramblers**: Tech that makes coincidences more likely
- **Star-Cross Detectors**: Warn when lovers from rival houses meet
