# History of Verona Prime - City of Star-Crossed Fates

## Foundation
Built by two allied families who discovered a massive deposit of emotion-crystals, Verona Prime was meant to be a paradise of enhanced human feeling.

## The Schism
A misunderstanding over a faulty love-potion recipe led to the first deaths, and the families have been feuding ever since.

## Present Tensions
The current generation wants peace, but ancient AIs and automated honor-systems keep the conflict alive.
